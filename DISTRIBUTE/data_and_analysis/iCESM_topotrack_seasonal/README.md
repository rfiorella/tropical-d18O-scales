# README

This directory contains `*.nc` and `*.csv` files with iCESM results that include the isotope gradient data and relevant streamlines. 

1. `Climo_MonthlyMean_ALL.nc` includes the climatological monthly mean data for each relevant variable (unprocessed – it doesn't include upwind gradient data). 
2. `slice_*_ds_withDd18.nc` includes the climatology and spatial isotope gradient data for the relevant timeslices `ann_prWtd` (precipitation weighted annual mean), `djf` (december, january, february) and `jja` (june, july, august). 
3. `slice_*_streamlines.csv` same breakdown above, but with upwind streamline data. 
4. `slice_sznAnom_jja-djf_upwindCrossover.nc` includes the seasonal anomaly with the computed upwind crossover point.
